Class: CMSC203 CRN 30376
Program: Assignment 5 Implementation
Instructor: Grinberg, Grigoriy
Summary of Description:

Minnie and Mickey are getting ready to send out Holiday bonuses
to their hard-working employees in Retail District #5.
The bonuses are calculated based on how much each retail store sold
in each category. The retail store with the highest amount sold
in a category will receive $5,000. The retail store
with the lowest amount sold in a category will receive $1,000.
All other retail stores in district #5 will receive $2,000.
If a retail store didnâ€™t sale anything in a category, or
they have a negative sales amount, they are not eligible for a bonus in that category.
If only one retail store sold items in a category,
they are eligible to receive only the bonus of $5000 for that category.
